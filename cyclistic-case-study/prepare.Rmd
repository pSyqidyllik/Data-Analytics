# Preparing/ Checking for Data Cleanliness

## Converted the started_at & end_at columns to 37:30:55 format of each datasets

## Added Columns for ride_length based on the previous converted columns, day_of_week, and month

## Merge all datasets:

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
library('lubridate')

b1 <- read_csv("202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")

b2 <- read_csv("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")

bt <- full_join(b1, b2)

b3 <- read_csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")

# Analysis

## Pre-analysis for common Statistics values

Mean of ride_length

```{r}
seconds_to_period(mean(bt$ride_length, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Max ride_length

```{r}
seconds_to_period(max(bt$ride_length, na.rm = TRUE))

```

```{r}
filter(bt, ride_length == 359085) #359085 seconds = "4d 3H 44M 45S"

```

Mode of day_of_week

```{r}
# no built-in function for mode in R, hence code for one
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

getmode(bt$day_of_week) #7 is Saturday

```

## Pivot tables

Average ride_length of Member types:

```{r}
bt %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(average_ride_length = seconds_to_period(mean(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE)))

```

Average ride_length per day of week:

```{r}
bt %>% group_by(day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(average_ride_length = seconds_to_period(mean(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE)))

```

Numbers of rides per day of week

```{r}
bt %>% group_by(day_of_week) %>% summarise(number_of_rides = n_distinct(ride_id))

```

## Data useful for viz:

-Number of Casual Riders vs. Annual Subscribers

```{r}
bt %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = (n_distinct(ride_id)))
```


-Number of rides per month

```{r}
bt %>% group_by(bt$month, member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = (n_distinct(ride_id)))

```

-Number of rides per week:

```{r}
bt %>% group_by(day_of_week, member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = (n_distinct(ride_id)))

```

# Share (Visualizations)

## Number of Casual Riders vs. Annual Subscribers

```{r}
df <- bt %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = (n_distinct(ride_id)))

ggplot(df) + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = member_casual, y = number_of_rides, 
                                      fill = member_casual)) + 
    labs(x = "Member", y = "Number of Riders", 
         title = "Rider Types of Cyclistic", 
         subtitle = "Casual vs. Annual Subscribers")
```
*-Though the number of members who avail the annual subscription is greater, it is **deceptive** to the **actual usage** of Cyclistic's bikes.*

## Number of Rides per Month

```{r}
df <- bt %>% select(month, member_casual, ride_id)
df <- mutate(df, month = my(df$month))

ggplot(df) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = month, fill = member_casual)) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Rides", title = "Number of Rides per month in 2021-2022")

```

```{r}
df <- df %>% group_by(month) %>% summarise(number_of_rides = n_distinct(ride_id))

ggplot(df) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = month, y = number_of_rides)) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Rides", title = "Number of Rides per month in 2021-2022")

```

*-Number of rides, especially by casuals, lowers around **November to February,** which makes sense because of rainy/winter season. It starts to return around **March onwards**, and get higher upon beginning and time of summer.*

-Hence, marketing should be focused as **summer times approach, during it, and few months after (around March to September).**

<br> <br>

## Number of Rides in a Week

```{r}
ggplot(bt) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = day_of_week, fill = member_casual)) +
  labs(x = "Day of Week", y = "Number of Rides", 
       title = "Average Number of Rides in a Week",
       subtitle = "1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, etc...") 

```

*-Data shows that there are more users during weekend, especially casuals.*

-Hence, promos like giving discounts for annual memberships' availability should be based in there, like **limited time offer during weekends.**

<br> <br>

## Ride Length in a Week

```{r}
df <- bt %>% select(day_of_week, member_casual, ride_length)
df <- df %>% group_by(day_of_week, member_casual) %>% summarise(ave_ride_len = mean(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(df) + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = day_of_week, y = df$ave_ride_len, fill = member_casual)) +
  labs(x = "Day of Week", y = "Ride Length in Seconds", 
       title = "Average Ride Length in a Week",
       subtitle = "1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, etc...") 
```

*-It could be seen that Casual users, as a group, collectively uses our bike in a **longer period of time**. This increases our outward cashflow, towards fund for maintenance for larger number of bikes that are used by them, even if they actually spend less money for our service.*

-Hence, this reinforces further the need of converting these casual users to our annual subscription.

# Conclusion
-Marketing should be ramped up as **summer** approaches, during, and a few months after it.



-Promos like limited time offerings should be given during **weekends**.



-Though annual subscribers are greater in number, casual members should still be converted, as that group could cost us more in the long run with maintenance of our bikes.
