-A case study of a fictional bike-rental company, though data is taken from actual business. I've analyzed a combination of 12 sets of data, as to find differences from casual bike riders and annual-subscribing members. This is also intended to help in persuading those casual users to avail the annual subscription, as it's significantly more profitable.

Tools used include **MS Excel** for simple data manipulation, and mainly **R** for actual analysis and visualization. Feel free to check out the **Roadmap** and **Slideshow Presentation** included in this folder or through this links:

-Analysis process is also documented in an **R notebook** (.Rmd file), along with a *knitted* HTML file of it.

Thank you!
